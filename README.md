# Tarang's CSM 70 Section

## Notes
The notes are in the respective week's folder. I will either have a formal type up with a pdf and/or just pictures of the board from section. 
These are for you to use, and are all material we went over in class. 
The purpose for having the notes in this format is so you can have access to them instantly, and the changes made between Monday and Wednesday sections persists on one pdf.
## About
I am a Applied Mathematics and Computer Science double major. I really enjoyed CS 70 and hope to have a productive semester with all of you this semester in CSM.
