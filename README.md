# Tarang's CSM 70 Section

## Notes
The notes are in the respective week's folder. I will either have a formal type up with a pdf and/or just pictures of the board from section. 
These are for you to use, and are all material we went over in class. 
## About
I am a Applied Mathematics and Computer Science double major. I really enjoyed CS 70 and hope to have a productive semester with all of you this semester in CSM.
